# migration1
first go at migration.

The files you want are the combinedyears files. The archived file just contains unjoined stages I may need later.


### Age Groups

There are three age groupings present in the data (shown below). We can't differentiate with
a dimension without introducing tons of sparsity.

Didnt want to mix all three in age as it'd look a bit mad so I've extracted as three separate files, so you can always merge them together if you like.
